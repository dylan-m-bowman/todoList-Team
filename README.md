Be sure to implement the topics you have learned in class up to this point.

 

If you choose to implement additional code that has not been covered in class, be sure the entire team agrees and seek prior approval from the instructor/TA.

 

You must include HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Primitive data types, objects, arrays, this keyword at a minimum and then be creative and include OOP!
